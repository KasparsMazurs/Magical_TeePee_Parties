## User Experience

### Goals

The purpose of this website is to showcase a rental company called 'Magical TeePee Parties' that offers remarkable and enchanting experiences for events such as children's sleepovers and birthday parties. The website enables potential clients to view the prices, images, and blog posts related to kids' parties, and make party bookings.

### Planning

A significant amount of effort went into the planning phase to determine the layout and structure of the agile board. Following a solo meeting where I switched between the roles of product owner, user, and developer, it was decided that Github projects would serve as the ideal agile tool for the Magical TeePee Parties PP4 project. With only limited time remaining until the project deadline, it was decided to break the development process into four iterations, each lasting one week.

Once the project's scope was clearly defined, I proceeded to create milestones and epics to help organize the development process. User stories and tasks were added to the backlog and prioritized using the M.o.S.C.o.W prioritization technique. Afterwards, each task was assigned to the appropriate milestone and iteration.

## Design

### Wireframes

Balsamiq was utilized to create the wireframes, and great effort was invested in ensuring that the final website would appear and function precisely as specified in the wireframes.

### Fonts

The website utilized Google fonts Alice and Playball to enhance the typography. The selection of these fonts was made to ensure the website's overall aesthetic and branding remain consistent. These fonts were chosen for their readability, clarity, and unique style.

## Testing

### Responsive Design

Regularly during development, Chrome Developer Tools was utilized to test the website's responsiveness on various screen sizes. The website's responsiveness was achieved through the use of Bootstrap 4 and CSS. The features section above demonstrates the website's responsiveness on different screen sizes.

### Validator Testing

**HTML**





![MTP Lighthouse](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AJFCJaUNxwdhAs9P14iKLuTUfK9ngFaVgiQ7R317G5t-heFL3BzP3YUPYg3T854_8Tg6r6Eihd-yNXYa6Mbr6wnyNyyJhZ3NLvFcwIEUj3urheieqAkaWamEd-GcnfYZLgkIhkNJ0IHZQfGG6rZHBKcd7ikDBQ=w1009-h620-s-no?authuser=0)

## Deployment

Acting on the instructor's advice of "deploying early to avoid problems down the line," we chose to deploy our website to Heroku right after the initial setup. This helped us identify and address any issues early on, resulting in a smoother development process. Additionally, it allowed us to test the website's performance and make improvements before the final release.

### Heroku

The website was deployed to Heroku using several steps. 
- First, a Heroku account was created and a new app was created with an app name and region. 
- Heroku Postgres was added as a resource and configured with a hobby dev plan. 
- Config vars were added in the settings tab, including SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL, and CLOUDINARY_URL. 
- The deploy tab was selected, and Deployment method was set to GitHub. 
- The main branch was chosen for manual deployment, and the app was deployed. 
- Automatic Deploy can also be enabled for ease of use. If the build fails, the resources tab can be accessed to view the build log and find out why it failed and how to fix it.

### Version Control

Throughout the development process, version control was managed using Github. The team utilized the platform to collaborate and manage changes to the codebase. Each feature and bug fix was implemented on a separate branch, and changes were reviewed and merged into the main branch via pull requests.

## Technologies used

- HTML5 for the contents and structure of the website.
- CSS3 for the styling and animations.
- Cloudinary for static files and media.
- Summernote for posting/design blog/news post
- Balsamiq for wireframing.
- GitHub as a remote repository.
- gitpod.io was used as IDE and git version control.
- Heroku to deploy the website/app.
- Chrome, Firefox, Brave Browser, Edge and Opera for browser testing the responsiveness.
- Chrome Developer Tools for testing screen sizes and using Lighthouse.
- Favicon.io to create a favicon.
- Image converter for optimizing images
- Bootstrap 4 for responsive design
- emailjs API for emails

### Frameworks

- Django

## Credits

- Inspiration for news was taken from the Code Institute project "Blog"
- Stackoverflow for providing solutions for problems in code
